<html><body><p><strong>Broadcom (AVGO)</strong> gapped lower today after a report from <em>The Information</em> highlighted <strong>Alphabet (GOOG)</strong> potentially moving away from AVGO's AI chips; instead, designing them in-house. The report also touched on the possibility GOOG replacing AVGO as its ethernet switches provider across its data centers, opting to buy from <strong>Marvell (MRVL)</strong>. </p><p>The move from GOOG follows its broader push to design its chips in-house. Earlier this year, <em>The Information</em> reported on GOOG replacing <strong>Samsung (SSNLF)</strong> by 2025 in favor of its in-house processors, designed by its Tensor team. With its primary smartphone competitor <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong>, already moving off third parties, like <strong>Intel (INTC)</strong>, opting for in-house designs, GOOG is following suit to maintain pace with the speed and efficiency improvements gained through developing a chip in-house. The move may also cut costs for GOOG by a material amount each year. </p><p><strong>What does this mean for AVGO?</strong> </p><ul><li> Although AAPL is AVGO's single-largest customer, comprising approximately 20% of FY22 (Oct) revenue, given its presence in the wireless communications industry, we suspect sales to GOOG make up a meaningful portion of total revenue, making GOOG's possible move material to future financials.</li><li>  Furthermore, AI is becoming a lucrative market for AVGO going forward. During its JulQ earnings call earlier this month, CEO Hock Tan stated that AI could comprise over 25% of its Semiconductor revenue in FY24, translating to around a fifth of total revenue. With the AI boom being a significant factor in AVGO's +45% jump YTD, any loss of AI-related demand could be met by meaningful disappointment and subsequent selling pressure. </li><li>It should also be noted how critical AI will likely be to AVGO's near-term financial performance. During JulQ, AVGO's AI product portfolio kept overall revenue from sinking yr/yr. Looking ahead to Q4 (Oct), AI will remain the silver lining during a challenging demand environment, keeping AVGO's Semiconductor segment from experiencing flat yr/yr revenue growth. </li><li>However, GOOG's shift away from AVGO for its AI chips may not result in a material hit to AVGO's quarterly results over the near term.&nbsp;<em>The Information</em> reported that GOOG would not drop AVGO as a supplier until 2027, although it was unclear if it would slowly wind down its dependence on AVGO in the interim. </li></ul><p> Today's news of GOOG potentially moving off AVGO  is undoubtedly a concerning development. AVGO shares have steadily declined after hitting all-time highs the day before JulQ results. There is plenty of enthusiasm surrounding AI, which has likely been priced into the stock, leaving open significant downside risk. Still, GOOG's possible move off AVGO does not underscore cooling AI demand. Instead, it follows a trend by the tech giant of designing more of its handset components in-house. While we remain cautious about AVGO given its considerable rally this year, its primary focus, AI, is still showing signs of outsized demand.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
