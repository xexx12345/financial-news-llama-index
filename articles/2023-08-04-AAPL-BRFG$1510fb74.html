<html><body><p>The unfavorable macroeconomic climate took a bite out of <strong>Apple (AAPL -3%) </strong>in Q3 (Jun). The iPhone maker did register decent earnings upside and in-line revs in the quarter. However, iPhone sales came up short of analyst expectations. Other products, including iPad and wearables, also took a hit as challenging yr/yr comparisons and FX headwinds added further obstacles. Discouragingly, Apple expects similar sales performance in Q4 (Sep), below what analysts forecasted. </p><ul><li> iPhone revenue slipped by 2% yr/yr in JunQ to $39.7 bln. However, on a constant currency basis, iPhone saw positive growth in the quarter, setting JunQ records in several emerging markets, such as India, which Apple has noted is at a tipping point, and Mexico. iPhone also overcame a difficult demand environment in parts of Europe, setting records across France, the Netherlands, and Austria. </li><li>Unlike last quarter, Mac revenue of $6.8 bln, a 7% dip, topped estimates in JunQ. Apple's transition to running its entire Mac lineup on its in-house silicon likely helped boost Mac sales, given the enormous jump in processing power over previous <strong>Intel (INTC)</strong> chips.</li><li>Conversely, iPad sales continued to underperform, tumbling 20% yr/yr to $5.8 bln. The lackluster growth stemmed partly from an unfavorable yr/yr comparison when Apple launched the revamped iPad Air. Although iPad comprises the smallest chunk of total revenue, it tends to be the device that attracts first-time customers into the Apple ecosystem, given the poor selection of competing tablets and frustrating Android <strong>(GOOG) </strong>support. With iPad more discretionary than a phone or computer, the demand backdrop could hinder new customer growth over the near term. </li><li>However, wearables, including the Apple Watch, which, albeit missed sales estimates,  could fill this void. CFO Luca Maestri mentioned that roughly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch were new to the product. When considering one of the best smartwatches to own, the Apple Watch typically tops the leaderboards. Since the best experience on an Apple Watch requires an iPhone, a potential Apple Watch buyer must also consider purchasing an iPhone. </li><li>While product revenue was down 4% yr/yr, Services revenue accelerated to +8%, up from the +5% posted in MarQ, reflecting the strength of Apple's ecosystem. As Apple bolsters its global presence, more users are exposed to the numerous services offered through Apple products, including Apple Arcade, Apple TV, and Apple Card, which is required to set up a high-yield savings account that has seen over $10 bln in despots since its Spring launch. </li></ul><p>Apple's JunQ report was mostly upbeat, containing several highlights from emerging market strength to accelerating Services growth. However, alongside weak iPhone sales, SepQ guidance translates to a possible fourth-straight quarter of declining revenue, a concerning development. Prominent suppliers <strong>Taiwan Semi (TSM)</strong> and <strong>Qualcomm (QCOM)</strong> have also warned about lingering global demand weakness for the remainder of the year, setting up for a potentially challenging 1Q24 (Dec) for Apple as well. Still, over the longer term, Apple is cementing itself as a leader in consumer tech, with the capacity to expand sales considerably with the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro early next year.    </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
