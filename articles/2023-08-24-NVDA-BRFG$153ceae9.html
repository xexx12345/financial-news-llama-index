<html><body><p>As one of the most highly-anticipated earnings reports this season, <strong>NVIDIA (NVDA +3%)</strong> did not underdeliver, clearing every Q2 (Jul) estimate easily and posting another remarkable quarterly outlook. As the primary supplier of GPUs powering large language models and other generative AI applications, NVDA's tremendous results continued to showcase the unwavering demand for AI. Although there were not many signs indicating any meaningful slowdown in AI-related demand ahead of NVDA's report, its valuation, trading at 18x FY25 (Jan) sales, provided a layer of uncertainty about whether the market already priced in impressive performance. </p><p> NVDA put these concerns to rest, justifying its premium valuation with its huge earnings and sales beats in Q2, expanding its bottom line by 429% yr/yr to $2.70 and top line by 102% to $13.51 bln. The company's Q3 (Oct) revenue guidance was just as upbeat, targeting revs of $15.68-16.32 bln, a 170% jump yr/yr at the midpoint. Additionally, by approving $25 bln in additional share buybacks, management signaled that its shares remain undervalued.</p><ul><li>  Data Center revenue, NVDA's largest segment at over half of annual sales, illuminated the robust AI demand, surging 171% yr/yr and 141% sequentially to $10.32 bln. Its HGX AI supercomputer was the star of the segment, with prominent cloud companies, like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, deploying HGX systems in volume. Critically, NVDA's Data Center growth was assisted by its supply partners, such as <strong>Taiwan Semi (TSM)</strong>, ramping capacity to support the demand. NVDA anticipates supply to increase each quarter through next year.<ul><li>Data Center sales were most substantial in the U.S., while China's contribution stayed within the historical range of 20-25%. </li><li> Speaking of China, NVDA briefly touched on the impacts of additional potential export restrictions on its GPUs. Given its worldwide demand, the company noted that an immediate effect would be negligible. However, longer-term restraints would likely result in a more material headwind. </li></ul></li><li>Gaming mounted a comeback, with sales climbing 22% yr/yr and 11% sequentially to $2.49 bln. The back-to-school season positively impacted laptop GPU sales, as is typical. NVDA stated that global demand has returned to growth after a lengthy slowdown in 2022. </li><li>Professional Visualization remained a laggard, falling 24% yr/yr, but jumping 28% sequentially. Lower sell-in to channel partners was the underlying factor behind the yr/yr decline as customers continued to normalize their inventory levels. </li><li>Automotive growth edged 15% higher yr/yr but slid 15% sequentially, reflecting soft demand in China. </li></ul><p>Although not the landmark moment we witnessed last quarter, NVDA's Q2 numbers were still excellent and underpinned sustained demand for AI. It is hard to bet against NVDA, especially as companies across varying verticals attach themselves to the AI frenzy. However, that does not mean NVDA trades risk-free. The company may have a stronghold on the AI GPU space currently. Still, other tech firms, like <strong>Intel (INTC)</strong> and potentially <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong>, will not just roll over and let NVDA run away with such a lucrative field -- NVDA estimates a trillion dollars worth of data centers transitioning into generative AI. Nevertheless, NVDA continues to pour additional cement on its foundation in the AI industry and will likely remain the leader for the foreseeable future.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
